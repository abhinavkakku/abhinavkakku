Hello People, today I am going to list some networking concepts that are essential when we want to start into security. This is more like a personal blog, and I am no expert into networking, I am just trying to set bare minimum topics we should all have some idea to understand what actually happens behind the screen ( in networking ).

This Article was last Updated on - **May 04, 2021**

So the list will not be exhaustive, also not in order, but it will be more of essential topics we should learn, and read from various sources to understand the very fundamentals.

Also the list below is not a compilation but something what I thought to learn , so the list keeps getting populated as I discover new topics, any suggestions or changes are always welcome through comments or Social-channels.

7. What is TCP and UDP ? Which one can be used where ?
8. OSI Layers of Network.
9. Realize or Visualize how traffic is initiated , initiated in which OSI Layer ? and how it travels through layers till it reaches the required recipients ? How its decoded at receiving end ? both top to bottom and bottom to top approach.
10. What is TCP/IP Layer of Network ? How it differs from OSI Layers ?
11. How are ports used to establish communication to services ? Basically initiating and listening concept of server client.
12. What is MAC Address / Physical Address ?
