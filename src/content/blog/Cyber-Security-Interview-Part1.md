Cyber Security Interview Questions is for students and working professionals who are preparing to get into , or switch to Cyber Security Job Roles . These questions are mostly crowd-sources , hence for many it may seem very trivial. I shall also add some questions that I faced in Cyber Security Interviews.

Different Cyber Security Job Roles - A look at different domains in Cyber Security, this is not perfect, but still can help to get some idea of different roles one might take in CYber Security Jobs

The Tweet above or the MindMap of different possible Cyber Security Job Roles will help me escape the Question - " Why every question is not Offensive or Defensive only, I only want Pentesting Questions, or only SOC Analyst Questions." 
Answer - " Cyber Security is big domain and needs for different roles are different. "
