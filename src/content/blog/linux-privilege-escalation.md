Linux Privilege Escalation.

This article like many other is a progressive one, that is will be updated with more related contents.

## System Enumeration
hostname - machine name, sometimes it is related to one of te exploits.

uname -a  -- tells Kernel Version, Architecure, these are helpful in kernel exploit or arch specific
cat /proc/version
cat /etc/issue

architecture information  - lscpu


What services are running - 

ps -aux  [ in order they started]
ps -aux | grep root - to find all that root is doing 


## User Enumeration

whoami
id - what user ID, group ID are assigned , to know privileges

sudo -l [ to know what we can do as sudo], check NOPASSWORD attributes, LD_PRELOAD

cat /etc/passwd - see the uers here on a machine
filter out the real users from 1000 ID

cat /etc/passwd | cut -d : 1

cat /etc/shadow

cat /etc/group


history - to know the commandline history

## Network Enumeration

ifconfig or ip a
ip route
arp -a
ip -neigh

netstat -ano ]-what ports are open, any communication to unusual IPs, any local open ports not discoverd externally ( maybe nmap) ,who we communicating with.

## Password Hunting 

Idea is to learn methods who to search files on machine

grep --color=auto -rnw  '/' -ie 'PASSWORD=' --color=always 2>/dev/null

locate password | more


history command
cat ~/.bash_history

find . -type f -exec grep -i -I "PASSWORD" {} /dev/null \;

## Weak File Permissions

ls -l /etc/passwd
ls -l /etc/shadow

## SSH Keys

find / -name authorized_keys 2> /dev/null
find / -name id_rsa 2> /dev/null


## Kernel Exploits

### Dirty Cow

gcc -pthread cow.c -o cow

passwd

get root
