Malware Analysis Lab is to learn more about Malwares, analyse them, RUN them in a controlled environment to know more about how they work. what is the behaviour of malware family.

Lets jump right into it.

Some pre-requsite :
- Idea of Virtual Machines,and how to setup one.

Most of the times when we talk about Malwae analysis Lab setup, we jump onto Flare-VM or Remnux, so I will leave that aside . 

1- Setup a Windows VM, Download the ISO of Windows 10 or Windows 11 from Microsoft's Website and setup the VM. You can use Microsoft PreBuilt VMs too.

2- Disable the Antivirus on the machine, Specially Real Time Protection, along with other protection components in Microsoft Defender (considering you dont have any other Antivirus on the Virtual machine we setup.)

3- Cleanup the Windows additional components that are not required. We do this via some bloatware removal scripts.

4- Install some Programming languages and Visual Studio Community (C, .Net).

5- Install x64DBG-Plugin Manager
configure x64DBG to run as administrator.

6- Install and configure ghidra.
